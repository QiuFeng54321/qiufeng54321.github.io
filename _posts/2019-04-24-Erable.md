# Erable

This is still under development, so it might be unstable.Please report bugs or request new features to me!  

## How to use

### Requirements

+ JDK 10+



## Syntax

***Note*** that the syntaxes below are expressed as RegExp,

### Basic Syntax Parts

there are some syntax `parts` which are used often.

#### Name

```
[a-zA-Z_\$][a-zA-Z0-9_\$]*
```

### ArgsDecl

```
:([Name]*)
```



### Basic Types

#### String

```
"string literal"
```

#### Integer

`0-9` and `a-z` is used depends on the radix.

Example:

```
0xa //10
```

this will first change the radix to 16 and evaluate the rest of the digits.

| header  | radix |
| ------- | ----- |
| Nothing | 10    |
| 0b      | 2     |
| 0o      | 8     |
| 0x      | 16    |





#### Array

```
[expr1,expr2,exr3,...]
```

returns a list of exprs.

### Variable Declaration

| Identifiers | Usage                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| var         | make this variable global                             |
| let         | make this variable declared only in the current scope |
| changeable  | this variable can be changed                          |
| const       | cannot change the value of the variable               |
| obj         | this variable stores a value                          |
| ref         | this variable stores a reference to another value     |

```
[Identifiers]+ [Name] [= Expr]
```

### Function Call

calls a function.

```
[Name](expr1,expr2,expr3,...)
```
### Binary Operations

| Operator     | Usage                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| \.           | access the field              |
| \+,\-,\*,/,% | plus, minus,times,devide,mod  |
| <<,\>\>      | binary shifting               |
| <<<,>>>      | unsigned binary shifting      |
| <=>          | swap two values               |
| ==,!=,\>=,<= | conditions                    |
| =            | set the value of the variable |
| &,\|,^       | bit and,bit or,bit xor        |

```
[Expr] [Identifer] [Expr2]
```

### Unary Operations

| Operator | Usage                       |
| :------- | --------------------------- |
| !        | bit not                     |
| @        | gets the value by reference |
| #        | gets the reference by value |
| return   | return a value              |

```
[Identifiers] [Expr]
```

### CodeBlocks

A group of codes.

```
{
    [Expr]*
}
(
    [Expr]*
)
```

If no return value is specified,the last expression will be evaluated and be set to the return value.



### If Expressions

```
if [CodeBlock condition] [CodeBlock do]
else [CodeBlock do]
```

To express something like `else if`, just place `else if`

### Loop Expressions

You can use `while` and `foreach` for looping.  

```
while [CodeBlock condition] [CodeBlock do]
```

`while` is activated until the condition returns false.

#### What It Does

+ It will first store the a's value to anonymous variable(in here we call it *backup*)
+ do things inside **[CodeBlock do]**
+ If exceptions happen,the protected value will be set back to *backup*.

### Function Declaration

declare a function.

```
function [Name function_name] [ArgsDecl args] [CodeBlock do]
```

If `function name` is not declared,the name will be instead of `anonymous_func0`,`anonymous_func1`,etc.

###  Load Native Library

loads a native java/c++ library.

```
load "libpath.lib";
```

### Declare a Native Function

Declares native function. The implementation is in native librar(y/ies).

```
native function [Name function_name] [ArgsDecl args] using 'native_method'
```

### Try-catch-finally

Excepts error(s) or not.Whether exceptions are caught or not, `finally` block will be executed.

**Note**: Finally Expression doesn't has to be written.

```
try{
    //do sth
}catch(e){
    //process
}finally{
    //finally do sth
}
```
