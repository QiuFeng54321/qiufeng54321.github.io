# LeafLang

I have been working on this since two weaks ago.  

This is still under development, so it might be unstable.Please report bugs or request new features to me!  

## How to use

### Requirements

+ Python 3 or later

run this in your terminal:  

```bash
cd LeafLang-compiler
python3 Node.py
```

You will get something like this:  

```
LeafLang Testing
>
```

Thats it! For now it will just parse the code and prints the serialized **Code Data**.I will keep developing this!

## Syntax

### Variable Declaration

| Identifiers | Usage                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| var         | make this variable global                             |
| let         | make this variable declared only in the current scope |
| changeable  | this variable can be changed                          |
| const       | cannot change the value of the variable               |
| obj         | this variable stores a value                          |
| ref         | this variable stores a reference to another value     |

```
[Identifiers]+ Name [= Expr]
```

### Binary Operations

| Operator     | Usage                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| \.           | access the field              |
| \+,\-,\*,/,% | plus, minus,times,devide,mod  |
| <<,\>\>      | binary shifting               |
| <<<,>>>      | unsigned binary shifting      |
| <=>          | swap two values               |
| ==,!=,\>=,<= | conditions                    |
| =            | set the value of the variable |
| &,\|,^       | bit and,bit or,bit xor        |

```
[Expr] [Identifer] [Expr2]
```

### Unary Operations

| Operator | Usage                       |
| :------- | --------------------------- |
| !        | bit not                     |
| @        | gets the value by reference |
| #        | gets the reference by value |
| return   | return a value              |
| emit     | emit a signal               |
| delete   | delete a value              |

```
[Identifiers] [Expr]
```

### CodeBlocks

```
{
    [Expr]*
}
(
	[Expr]*
)
```



### If Expressions

```
(if|elif) [CodeBlock condition] [CodeBlock do]
else [CodeBlock do]
```
