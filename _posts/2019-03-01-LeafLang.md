# LeafLang

I have been working on this since two weaks ago.  

This is still under development, so it might be unstable.Please report bugs or request new features to me!  

## How to use

### Requirements

+ Python 3 or later

run this in your terminal:  

```bash
cd LeafLang-compiler
python3 Node.py
```

You will get something like this:  

```
LeafLang Testing
>
```

Thats it! For now it will just parse the code and prints the serialized **Code Data**.I will keep developing this!

## Syntax

***Note*** that the syntaxes below are expressed as RegExp,

### Basic Syntax Parts

there are some syntax `parts` which are used often.

`back slashes` are for raw texts like `\(` in RegExp is different than `(` 

#### Name

```
[a-zA-Z_\$][a-zA-Z0-9_\$]*
```

### ArgsDecl

```
:\([Name}*\)
```



### Basic Types

#### String

```
"string literal"
```

#### Integer

`0-9` and `a-z` is used depends on the radix.

Example:

```
16rabcdef102
```

this will first change the radix to 16 and evaluate the rest of the digits.

The max radix supported is *36*



#### Array

```
[expr1,expr2,exr3,...]
```

returns a list of exprs.

### Variable Declaration

| Identifiers | Usage                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| var         | make this variable global                             |
| let         | make this variable declared only in the current scope |
| changeable  | this variable can be changed                          |
| const       | cannot change the value of the variable               |
| obj         | this variable stores a value                          |
| ref         | this variable stores a reference to another value     |

```
[Identifiers]+ [Name] [= Expr]
```

### Function Call

calls a function.

```
[Name](expr1,expr2,expr3,...)
```
### Binary Operations

| Operator     | Usage                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| \.           | access the field              |
| \+,\-,\*,/,% | plus, minus,times,devide,mod  |
| <<,\>\>      | binary shifting               |
| <<<,>>>      | unsigned binary shifting      |
| <=>          | swap two values               |
| ==,!=,\>=,<= | conditions                    |
| =            | set the value of the variable |
| &,\|,^       | bit and,bit or,bit xor        |

```
[Expr] [Identifer] [Expr2]
```

### Unary Operations

| Operator | Usage                       |
| :------- | --------------------------- |
| !        | bit not                     |
| @        | gets the value by reference |
| #        | gets the reference by value |
| return   | return a value              |
| emit     | emit a signal               |
| delete   | delete a value              |

```
[Identifiers] [Expr]
```

### CodeBlocks

A group of codes.

```
{
    [Expr]*
}
(
    [Expr]*
)
```

If no return value is specified,the last expression will be evaluated and be set to the return value.



### If Expressions

```
(if|elif) [CodeBlock condition] [CodeBlock do]
else [CodeBlock do]
```

### Emit and Signals

Signals will be activated when it is emitted.   
It can be declared like this:  

```
signal(exprtag) [CodeBlock do]
```

Where expr tag is the key which emit can activate.  

Emit Expression:

```
emit exprtag
```

It activates the signal which is declared with the same exprtag.

### Loop Expressions

You can use `while` and `foreach` for looping.  

```
while [CodeBlock condition] [CodeBlock do]
```

`while` is activated until the condition returns false.

```
foreach [CodeBlock iterator] [CodeBlock do]
```

`foreach`iterates the iterator.

### Protect Expression

```
protect [CodeBlock protect] [CodeBlock do]
```

`[CodeBlock protect]` must return a reference to variable.(Usage of reference of variable:`#variable_name`  )

```
protect(a){
    do(a)
}
```

#### What It Does

+ It will first store the a's value to anonymous variable(in here we call it *backup*)
+ do things inside **[CodeBlock do]**
+ If exceptions happen,the protected value will be set back to *backup*.

### With Expression

Just like `using` in c++.

```
with [CodeBlock namespace] [CodeBlock do]
```

For Example:

```
with(mymodule){
    module_method_a(0123)
}
```

It defines all methods and fields into the current **scope**.

For the example `module_method_a` is defined in `mymodule` and can be referenced directly without using  `mymodule.module_method_a`

### Foreach Expression

Iterates the object.

```
foreach [ArgsDecl variables] [ArgsDecl iterators] [CodeBlock do]
```



### Function Declaration

declare a function.

```
function [Name function_name] [ArgsDecl args] [CodeBlock do]
function [Name function_name] [CodeBlock do]
function [ArgsDecl args] [CodeBlock do]
function [ArgsDecl args]
function [CodeBlock do]
```

If `function name` is not declared,the name will be instead of `anonymous_func0`,`anonymous_func1`,etc.

### Class Declaration
declare a class.

```
class [Name class_name] [ArgsDecl extends] [CodeBlock do]
class [Name class_name] [CodeBlock do]
class [ArgsDecl extends] [CodeBlock do]
class [ArgsDecl extends]
class [CodeBlock do]
```

It is just like `function declaration`,and acts like it when it is *anonymous*.It is always called `anonymous_class0`,etc.
